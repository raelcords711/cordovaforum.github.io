<h3>Samsung Galaxy S8</h3>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S8 and Samsung Galaxy S8+ (shortened to S8 and S8+, respectively) are Android smartphones produced by Samsung Electronics as part of the Samsung Galaxy S series. Unveiled on 29 March 2017, they succeed the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, with a North American release on 21 April 2017 and UK availability on 28 April 2017.

The S8 and S8+ contain upgraded hardware and major design changes over their predecessors, the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, including larger screens with a taller aspect ratio and curved sides on both the smaller and larger models, iris and face recognition, a new suite of virtual assistant features known as Bixby (along with a new dedicated physical button for launching the assistant), and a docking station accessory that allows the phones to be used with a personal computer-styled desktop interface with keyboard and mouse input support.

The S8 and S8+ received mostly positive reviews. Their design and form factor received praise, while critics also liked the updated software and camera optimizations. They received criticism for duplicate software apps, lackluster Bixby features at launch, for the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the rear next to the camera and for poor biometric options for unlocking the phone. Videos published after the phones' release have proven that the devices' facial and iris scanners can be fooled by suitable photographs of the user.

The S8 and S8+ were in high demand at release. During the pre-order period, a record one million units were booked in South Korea, and overall sales numbers were 30% higher than the Galaxy S7. However, subsequent reports in May announced sales of over five million units, a notably lower first-month sales number than previous Galaxy S series models.</p>
